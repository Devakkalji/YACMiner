# Scrypt & N-Scrypt

While the main purpose of YACMiner is to mine Scrypt-Chacha based coins, the 
ability to mine scrypt and N-Scrypt based coins has been added to this miner.
This document will deal mainly with scrypt-chacha, most of which applies to
N-Scrypt as well.  Standard Scrypt will not be discussed as there are numerous
resources already dedicated to this topic.

# Scrypt-chacha

Scrypt-chacha mining, AKA YACoin AKA scrypt-jane mining, for GPU is completely 
different to sha256 used for bitcoin mining, or even normal scrypt mining. 
The algorithm was originally developed in a manner that it was anticipated 
would make it suitable for mining on CPU but NOT GPU.  Thanks to some 
innovative work by Artforz and mtrlt, this was proven to be wrong. However, 
it has very different requirements to bitcoin mining and is a lot more 
complicated to get working well. Note that it is a ram dependent workload, and 
requires you to have enough system ram as well as fast enough GPU ram. If you
have less system ram than your GPU has, it may not be possible to mine at any 
reasonable rate.

There are 4 main parameters to tuning scrypt-chacha, all of which are optional
for further fine tuning. When you start scrypt-chacha mining with the 
--scrypt-chacha option, yacminer will do its best to try and set values for
the mandatory fields.  This is less than optimal, and you are likely to
have sub-optimal performance, HW errors, or possibly even crash your computer.
They are all due to parameters being outside what the GPU can cope with.

NOTE that if it does not fail at startup, the presence of hardware errors (HW)
are a sure sign that you have set the parameters too high.

## Drivers And OpenCL SDK

The choice of driver version for your GPU is critical, as some are known to
break scrypt mining entirely while others give poor hashrates. As for the
OpenCL SDK installed, for AMD it must be version 2.6 or later.

Step 1 on linux:

	export GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT=100
	export GPU_MAX_HEAP_SIZE=100

If you do not do this, you may find it impossible to mine. You may find
a value of 40 is enough and increasing this further has little effect.

	export GPU_USE_SYNC_OBJECTS=1

may help CPU usage a little as well.

On windows the same commands can be passed via a batch file if the following
lines are in the .bat before starting YACMiner:

	setx GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT 100
	setx GPU_USE_SYNC_OBJECTS 1

--buffer-size XXXX (-B XXXX):
This setting sets the size of the OpenCL buffer to allocate to each thread.  
This option overrides --thread-concurrency, and should be used instead of it.
This value should be based on the amount of available memory on your GPU.  
This setting is NOT affected by lookup-gap meaning that other tuning parameters 
that you want to test will not force you to recalculate your buffer-size.  The 
only setting that will make you want to change this is the --gpu-threads (-g)
setting.  As buffer-size is the amount of memory to allocate per thread, if you 
increase the number of threads you are launching, you will want to decrease the 
buffer-size of each thread to ensure all of the memory resides in Dedicated GPU 
memory instead of rolling over to Dynamic.

As the NFactor for a coin increases, the amount of memory that is needed to 
perform a single calculation rises.  The more memory that can be allocated per
thread, the better the performance that typically can be achieved.

SUMMARY: adjust this value first - Run GPUz to monitor the amount of dedicated
    memory used on the card until it moves into the dynamic column, then reduce 
    it back down.  YACMiner will tell you at the start how much memory has been
    allocated per thread

--lookup-gap X:
This tunes a compromise between ram usage and performance. Performance peaks
at a gap of 2, but increasing the gap may allow you to run at a higher rate
as more shaders in the card get utilized.  Setting lookup gap overrides the 
default of 4.
SUMMARY: Start at 2, and try 4 through 8.  Adjust your intensity setting 
    (-R/-X/-I) to higher values as the lookup-gap increases.

--worksize XXX (-w 256):
Has a minor effect, should be a multiple of 32 up to 256 maximum.  This sets
the smallest size of work being sent to the GPU, and on 5XXX series cards 
affects the values allowed in Raw Intensity.
SUMMARY: Higher values are better for cards with higher shader counts and 7XXX
    series cards and newer.  Lower values for older cards give finer ranges of
    Raw Intensity to maximize performance.

--rawintensity XXXX (-R XXXX)
All of this is credited to Kalroth.

This new setting allows for a much finer grained intensity setting and also opens 
up for dual cpu threads on devices not previously able to. Note: make sure to use 
much lower raw-intensity values when you increase cpu threads (-g).

The original Intensity setting is currently used to spawn GPU threads as a 
simple 2^value setting.
  I:8  =     128 threads
  I:8  =     256 threads
  I:9  =     512 threads
  I:10 =    1024 threads
  I:11 =    2048 threads
  I:12 =    4096 threads
  I:13 =    8192 threads
Notice how the higher settings increase thread count tremendously.

It's now much easier to control thread intensity specifically and it potentially 
allows for a uniform way of setting the intensity on your system.

This change has been tested on R7, 5870, 7850 - all with better speeds than using
a regular intensity setting after a little tuning, but your mileage may vary. 
If this doesn't work for you, or you do not want to spend time fine-tuning, the 
regular intensity setting is still available.

You can also set this value through the ncurses interface by pressing:
G -> A -> select device id -> enter value.

Valid values for raw-intensity need to be in multiples of --worksize.  Cards in the 
R7 and R9 family may allow for adjustment in smaller increments - the lowest found 
has been adjustment in multiples of 8.  The following is a guideline on where to 
start with your card and will most likely not be the exact numbers you end up with.

Memory	# of shaders	LG	Raw Intensity
1GB	Low Shaders	4	Shaders*4
2GB	Low Shaders	2	Shaders*2
2GB	Low Shaders	4	Shaders*8
1GB	High Shaders	8	Shaders*1
2GB	High Shaders	4	Shaders*2

Adjust Raw Intensity up and/or down until you no longer receive HW errors in the GUI.

Optional parameters to tune:
--gpu-threads X (-g X):
Some cards with large amounts of memory and low amounts of system memory will 
need to run multiple CPU threads so that all of the GPU memory can be 
allocated.  This is because the OpenCL buffer is built in system memory and 
passed to the GPU.  This defaults to 1, however values of 1, 2, 3 & 4 can all 
produce similar or better results.
SUMMARY: Run 1 unless your card has more than 2GB of memory and you cannot
allocate all of the memory with just 1 thread.

Other available parameters that have better alternatives:
--thread-concurrency XXXXX:
This option has been depreciated.  It is still available for those people who
like to do math on really high numbers that have to change when any other
parameter needs to change.  I strongly recommend utilizing the --buffer-size 
option instead.  This setting adjusts the size of the OpenCL buffer to allocate 
to each thread.  This value should be based on the amount of available memory 
on your GPU.  This setting is affected by lookup-gap as well, utilizing the 
following formula for lookup-gaps of 1,2 & 4

MB per thread = thread-concurrency * 128 / (1024 * lookup-gap)

A good example of this: lookup-gap of 2, thread-concurrency of 8192 = 512 MB

As the NFactor for a coin increases, the amount of memory that is needed to 
perform a single calculation rises.  The more memory that can be allocated per
thread, the better the performance that typically can be achieved.
SUMMARY: Use --buffer-size instead

--intensity XX (-I XX)
Just like in bitcoin mining, scrypt mining takes an intensity, however the
scale goes from 0 to 20 to mimic the "Aggression" used in mtrlt's reaper. The
reason this is crucial is that too high an intensity can actually be
disastrous with scrypt because it CAN run out of ram. High intensities
start writing over the same ram and it is highly dependent on the GPU, but they
can start actually DECREASING your hashrate, or even worse, start producing
garbage with HW errors skyrocketing. Note that if you do NOT specify an
intensity, YACMiner uses dynamic mode which is designed to minimise the harm
to a running desktop and performance WILL be poor. The lower limit to intensity
is controlled by the work size and is 8 with a work size of 256.  Lower work
sizes will allow a lower intensity.
SUMMARY: Setting this for reasonable hashrates is mandatory.  This setting is
    not recommended for coins with a high NFactor - use --raw-intensity

--xintensity XX (-X XX)
All of this is credited to ArGee of RGMiner, he did the initial ground work for 
this setting.

This setting is included as an option, however will not be useful on most cards
as the number of shaders is too high for the amount of memory available on those
cards.  This setting has been found to be useful on the AMD R7 240 and R7 250, 
however, --rawintensity can give the same, or better results with some tweaking.

--shaders XXX
is an option where you tell YACMiner how many shaders your GPU has. This
helps YACMiner try to choose some meaningful baseline parameters. Use this table
below to determine how many shaders your GPU has, and note that there are some
variants of these cards, and nvidia shaders are much much lower and virtually
pointless trying to mine on. If this is not set, YACMiner will query the
device for how much memory it supports and will try to set a value based on
that.
SUMMARY: This is carried over from low N scrypt mining .  You really want to 
    be setting buffer-size, lookup-gap and raw-intensity instead.

--vectors XX (-v XX)
Vectors are NOT used by the scrypt mining kernel.
SUMMARY: Does nothing.

Mining Other Scrypt-Chacha Coins: (version 3.4.2 and higher)
The following paramters are included to allow the user to specify parameters needed
to mine other SC based coins, such as YBCoin, Ultracoin, and Microcoin.
Each of these parameters are tied to a specific pool, so for every pool specified by
the -o parameter, you will need to specify each of the following or that pool will
default to the values used for YACoin.

Example (single line broken up for readability):
yacminer --scrypt --worksize 32 --lookup-gap 4 -g 1 -R 736 --thread-concurrency 24192 
    -o stratum+tcp://yac.coinmine.pl:9088 -u Me.miner -p x --nfmin 4 --nfmax 30 --starttime 1367991200 
    -o stratum+tcp://tix.coinmine.pl:6111 -u Me.miner -p x --nfmin 4 --nfmax 30 --starttime 1379622160

NOTE: If all of your pools are for YACoin, you do not need to use these parameters.  However, if ANY pool
is NOT YACoin, every pool must have them specified.
NOTE: These settings will get written to the yacoin.conf if you save your settings that way!

--nfmin XX (4 to 40, default: 4)
The lowest N Factor used for this coin

--nfmax XX (4 to 40, default: 30)
The highest N Factor used for this coin

--starttime XXXXXXXXXX (1 to 2147483647, default: 1367991200)
The unix starttime for the coin.  This is usually published with a coin, but may
need to be found in the source code.

The following are some notable Scrypt-Chacha coins and the parameters to use to
configure YACMiner to mine them - this is not a comprehensive list.

Coin			NFMin	NFMax	Starttime
YACoin			4	30	1367991200
YBCoin			4	30	1372386273
ZcCoin			4	30	1375817223
Lottery Tickets		4	30	1379622160
Velocity Coin & QQCoin	4	30	1387769316
Microcoin		4	30	1389028879
Ultracoin		4	30	1388361600


Overclocking for scrypt mining:
First of all, do not underclock your memory initially. Scrypt mining requires
memory speed and on most, but not all, GPUs, lowering memory speed lowers
mining performance.

Second, absolute engine clock speeds do NOT correlate with hashrate. The ratio
of engine clock speed to memory matters, so if you set your memory to the
default value, and then start overclocking as you are running it, you should
find a sweet spot where the hashrate peaks and then it might actually drop if
you increase the engine clock speed further.

Third, the combination of motherboard, CPU and system ram ALSO makes a
difference, so values that work for a GPU on one system may not work for the
same GPU on a different system. A decent amount of system ram is actually
required for scrypt mining, and 4GB is suggested.

Good luck, and if this doesn't work for you, well same old magic discussion
applies, I cannot debug every hardware combo out there.

Your numbers will be your numbers depending on your hardware combination and OS,
so don't expect to get exactly the same results!
