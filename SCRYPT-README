# Scrypt-chacha

Scrypt-chacha mining, AKA YACoin mining, for GPU is completely different to sha256
used for bitcoin mining. The algorithm was originally developed in a manner
that it was anticipated would make it suitable for mining on CPU but NOT GPU.
Thanks to some innovative work by Artforz and mtrlt, this was proven to be
wrong. However, it has very different requirements to bitcoin mining and is a
lot more complicated to get working well. Note that it is a ram dependent
workload, and requires you to have enough system ram as well as fast enough
GPU ram. If you have less system ram than your GPU has, it may not be possible
to mine at any reasonable rate.

There are 5 main parameters to tuning scrypt, all of which are optional for
further fine tuning. When you start scrypt mining with the --scrypt option,
yacminer will fail IN RANDOM WAYS. They are all due to parameters being outside
what the GPU can cope with.

NOTE that if it does not fail at startup, the presence of hardware errors (HW)
are a sure sign that you have set the parameters too high.

## Drivers And OpenCL SDK

The choice of driver version for your GPU is critical, as some are known to
break scrypt mining entirely while others give poor hashrates. As for the
OpenCL SDK installed, for AMD it must be version 2.6 or later.

Step 1 on linux:

	export GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT=100

If you do not do this, you may find it impossible to scrypt mine. You may find
a value of 40 is enough and increasing this further has little effect.

	export GPU_USE_SYNC_OBJECTS=1

may help CPU usage a little as well.

On windows the same commands can be passed via a batch file if the following
lines are in the .bat before starting YACMiner:

	setx GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT 100
	setx GPU_USE_SYNC_OBJECTS 1

--intensity XX (-I XX)

Just like in bitcoin mining, scrypt mining takes an intensity, however the
scale goes from 0 to 20 to mimic the "Aggression" used in mtrlt's reaper. The
reason this is crucial is that too high an intensity can actually be
disastrous with scrypt because it CAN run out of ram. High intensities
start writing over the same ram and it is highly dependent on the GPU, but they
can start actually DECREASING your hashrate, or even worse, start producing
garbage with HW errors skyrocketing. Note that if you do NOT specify an
intensity, YACMiner uses dynamic mode which is designed to minimise the harm
to a running desktop and performance WILL be poor. The lower limit to intensity
is controlled by the work size and is 8 with a work size of 256.  Lower work
sizes will allow a lower intensity.
SUMMARY: Setting this for reasonable hashrates is mandatory.

--xintensity XX (-X xx)
All of this is credited to ArGee of RGMiner, he did the initial ground work for 
this setting.

This setting is included as an option, however will not be useful on most cards
as the number of shaders is too high for the amount of memory available on those
cards.  This setting has been found to be useful on the AMD R7 240 and R7 250, 
however, --rawintensity can give better results with some tweaking.

--rawintensity XXXX (-R XXXX)
All of this is credited to Kalroth.

This new setting allows for a much finer grained intensity setting and also opens 
up for dual cpu threads on devices not previously able to. Note: make sure to use 
lower rawintensity values when you increase cpu threads (-g).

The original Intensity setting is currently used to spawn GPU threads as a 
simple 2^value setting.
  I:8  =     128 threads
  I:8  =     256 threads
  I:9  =     512 threads
  I:10 =    1024 threads
  I:11 =    2048 threads
  I:12 =    4096 threads
  I:13 =    8192 threads
Notice how the higher settings increase thread count tremendously.

It's now much easier to control thread intensity specifically and it potentially 
allows for a uniform way of setting the intensity on your system.

This change has been tested on R7, 5870, 7850 - all with better speeds than using
a regular intensity setting after a little tuning, but your mileage may vary. 
If this doesn't work for you, or you do not want to spend time fine-tuning, the 
regular intensity setting is still available.

You can also set this value through the ncurses interface by pressing:
G -> A -> select device id -> enter value.

Values need to be in multiples of 8 (at a minimum), and older cards appear to need
a multiple of 64.  Start with 256, 512, or 1024 and adjust in increments of 64 either
up or down.  Adjust this until you no longer receive HW errors in the GUI.

--shaders XXX

is a new option where you tell YACMiner how many shaders your GPU has. This
helps YACMiner try to choose some meaningful baseline parameters. Use this table
below to determine how many shaders your GPU has, and note that there are some
variants of these cards, and nvidia shaders are much much lower and virtually
pointless trying to mine on. If this is not set, YACMiner will query the
device for how much memory it supports and will try to set a value based on
that.
SUMMARY: This will get you started but fine tuning for optimal performance is
required.

--thread-concurrency:
Absolutely set this.  This adjusts the size of the OpenCL buffer to allocate 
to each thread.  This value should be based on the amount of available memory 
on your GPU.  This setting is affected by lookup-gap as well, utilizing the 
following formula for lookup-gaps of 1,2 & 4

MB per thread = thread-concurrency * 128 / (1024 * lookup-gap)

A good example of this: lookup-gap of 2, thread-concurrency of 8192 = 512 MB

As the NFactor for YACoin increases, the more memory that can be allocated per
thread, the better performance you typically can achieve.
SUMMARY: adjust this value first - Run GPUz to monitor the amount of dedicated
memory used on the card until it moves into the dynamic column, then reduce it
back down.  YACMiner will tell you at the start how much memory has been
allocated per thread

--lookup-gap:
This tunes a compromise between ram usage and performance. Performance peaks
at a gap of 2, but increasing the gap can save you some GPU ram, but almost
always at the cost of significant loss of hashrate. Setting lookup gap
overrides the default of 2, but YACMiner will use the --shaders value to choose
a thread-concurrency if you haven't chosen one.
SUMMARY: Start at 2, and try 1 and 4, adjusting thread-concurrency to
maximize the amount of memory allocated

Optional parameters to tune:
-g:
Some cards with large amounts of memory will need to run multiple CPU threads
so that all of the GPU memory can be allocated.  This defaults to 1, however
values of 1, 2, 3 & 4 can all produce similar or better results.
SUMMARY: Run 1 unless your card has more than 2GB of memory and you cannot
allocate all of the memory with just 1 thread.

--buffer-size:
Specify the amount of memory to allocate per thread in MB.  For now, still set
thread-concurrency, but this parameter can allocate slightly more memory.

Related parameters:
--worksize XX (-w XX):
Has a minor effect, should be a multiple of 64 up to 256 maximum.
SUMMARY: Worth playing with once everything else has been tried but will
probably do nothing.

--vectors XX (-v XX)
Vectors are NOT used by the scrypt mining kernel.
SUMMARY: Does nothing.

Overclocking for scrypt mining:
First of all, do not underclock your memory initially. Scrypt mining requires
memory speed and on most, but not all, GPUs, lowering memory speed lowers
mining performance.

Second, absolute engine clock speeds do NOT correlate with hashrate. The ratio
of engine clock speed to memory matters, so if you set your memory to the
default value, and then start overclocking as you are running it, you should
find a sweet spot where the hashrate peaks and then it might actually drop if
you increase the engine clock speed further.

Third, the combination of motherboard, CPU and system ram ALSO makes a
difference, so values that work for a GPU on one system may not work for the
same GPU on a different system. A decent amount of system ram is actually
required for scrypt mining, and 4GB is suggested.

Good luck, and if this doesn't work for you, well same old magic discussion
applies, I cannot debug every hardware combo out there.

Your numbers will be your numbers depending on your hardware combination and OS,
so don't expect to get exactly the same results!
